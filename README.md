Malibü 2
========

SIXLEG
------

This is the code i implemented for "Malibü 2" alias Sixleg at the 34C3 in Leibzig Dec 2017.

[![Sixleg](https://github.com/emdete/Sixleg/raw/master/2017-12-27T15:34:28-2.jpg)](https://github.com/emdete/Sixleg/raw/master/2017-12-27T15:34:28.webm)

My code is ugly as it is just a cut&paste flow of commands to lift the feet or move the legs, this could be done better.

My code contains "modes" that are choosen by random (like walk, sit, ...).

PRs welcome
-----------

If someone wants to add her/his code please send PRs, i sent this URL over to the artist who made this masterpiece of a bug.

Trivia
------

I gave this bug the name Sixleg when i first found it. Later i found its name is "Malibü 2".

On the last day of the congress Sixleg broke. The carpet was already dead the day before but Sixleg survived longer. But finally a joint broke and the left rear leg was overflexed and broke an air hose. So i programmed "alloff" to remove air pressure from all hoses. Deploying the program let Sixleg lay down completly.

TODOs
-----

- Implement a better model to express the flow

- Improve timing (how long does a move really take?)

- Make the rythm mode work

- Add a BT and enable wireless stearing

- Add validation of commands

Future
------

See you on the **35c3**!
