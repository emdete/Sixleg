SIXLEG
======

This is the code i implemented for the bug at the 34C3 in Leibzig Dec 2017.

[![Bug](https://github.com/emdete/Sixleg/raw/master/2017-12-27T15:34:28-2.jpg)](https://github.com/emdete/Sixleg/raw/master/2017-12-27T15:34:28.webm)

My code is ugly as it is just a cut&paste flow of commands to lift the feet or move the legs, this could be done better.

My code contains "modes" that are choosen by random (like walk, sit, ...).

PRs welcome
-----------

If someone want to add her/his code please send PRs, i sent this URL over to the artist who made the masterpiece.

TODOs
-----

- Implement a better model to express the flow

- Improve timing (how long does a move really take?)

- Make the rythm mode work

- Add a BT and enable wireless stearing

- Add validation of commands

Trivia
------

The bug has a name which is not Sixlegs as i named it when i found it. I heard the name but my bad memory for names lost it again.

On the last day of the congress the bug broke. The carpet was already dead but the bug survived longer. But finally a joint broke and the left rear leg was overflexed and a airtube broke. So i programmed "alloff" to remove air pressure from all tubes in the end. Deploying the program let the bug completly lay down.
